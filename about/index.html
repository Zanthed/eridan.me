                            <h2 id="who-am-i">Who am I?</h2>
                            <p>I'm June, a systems administrator and security researcher. I mainly strive in Linux server administration and security. I study cybersecurity and security research on common operating systems, hardware, philosophies and myths, and the generalities about computer security.</p>
                            <p>Started out in real world Linux administration at a very young age, around 10 years old. Tinkering with desktop Linux systems since 8. Messing with computers in general since 6. It all just falls into my lap and end up learning incredibly from it. Not sure how I truly ended up here, but it's something I am very intelligent in.</p>

                            <p>OUTSIDE of the tech world: I'm a (filthy) Homestuck. Still haven't fully read it yet. I know, I know I'm 8+ years late to the party and I've completely missed the party :(</p>
                               <p>Had a huge phase in Hazbin Hotel and Helluva Boss until I've started to notice the overhype was not worth it. Viv trying to make a buck by selling mediocre and out right awful merch by a terrible company and years of hyping up only to go completely against what she intended by signing off the IP of Hazbin Hotel to A24, and Helluva Boss was nothing like the pilot. It's a really dumb version of Family Guy with no story, inconsistent characters, and even out right swapping some of the voice actors. The HH pilot was released in Q4 2019 and not a SINGLE update has came out ever since. Helluva Boss episodes are being released quickly with mediocre effort at best. Sorry, but Viv lost her touch with serious animation. It would be amazing if we can go back to her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PKNuZovuSw">true roots</a>.</p>
                               <p>I love music but my taste is like a rollercoaster and out right bad. So no I will not tell you what I listen to.</p>
                               <p>I used to be heavily involved in many large Discord servers from moderation and administration to development. However, due to Discord being one of the worst platforms in existence with issues ranging from poorly designed software, difficult UI and UX, refusal to implement basic features, to out right awful support and moderation, bad marketing, failure to uphold ToS and Community Guidelines, shady business practices, criminal employees and staff, and so many more I cannot list here. Unfortunately, I will no longer be apart of a platform like this and my Discord is restricted to very few people who I deem deserve it that cannot migrate to other platforms. Contact me through other platforms I listed.</p>
