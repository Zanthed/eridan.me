## Who am I?

I'm **June**. I'm a *blue teamer*, *security researcher*, and *system administrator*. My pronouns are **she/her** and **they/them**. I mainly strive in Linux server administration and security. I study cybersecurity and security research on common operating systems, hardware, philosophies and myths, and the generalities about computer security.

I'm quite experienced in the field: starting out in real-world Linux administration at a very young age â€” around 10 years old; tinkering with desktop Linux systems since 8; and messing with computers in general since 6. It all just falls into my lap and end up learning incredibly from it. Not sure how I truly ended up here, but it's something I am very intelligent in.

I love Homestuck, Hiveswap, Vast Error, and other obscure things.

## Where am I?

Unfortunately, I am a Floridian in the US.
